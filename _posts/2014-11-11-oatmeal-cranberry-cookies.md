	<p> Oatmeal cookies are one of the ultimate holiday indulgences. They are a classic, chewy treat that will always remind you of your clildhood. I've taken the liberty to switch up this classic recipie by swapping out the traditional rasins with dried cranberries. The slightly tart cranberries help balance out the sweetness of these lovely bite sized treats. I hope you enjoy!
