	<p> Hummingbird cake is one of my absolue favorites. Its beyond sweet, rich and oh so bad for you. My very good friend was celebrating her 37th birthay and made a special request to have me bake this cake for her. Since we would be celebrating on Halloween I felt it only appropriate to adorn the already decorated cake with some beautifly placed plastic spiders. I'll admit, it was a little creepy to look at but just festive enough to celebrate in style. Please enjoy one of my favorite recipies of all time - spiders are optional.
