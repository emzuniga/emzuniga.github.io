First day of class, lots of nerves. I have't been in a classroom for 15 years and the thought of homework is giving me heartburn. Here goes nothing.

Most of our time this first class was spent installing all kinds of stuff. I call it "stuff" becuase really, I have no idea what to call <strong>THIS</strong>. Thankfully, I have some great people sharing a work table with me and they were able to walk me through some of the more confusing pieces. One of the instructors did a quick overview of what's to come...seriously, I was scared. What if I can't keep up? I guess we will just have to see how the following weeks go.
