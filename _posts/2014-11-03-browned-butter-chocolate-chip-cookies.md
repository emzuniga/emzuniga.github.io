<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees</p>
<p>2. Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats</p>
<p>3. Sift or whisk together the flour and baking soda in a medium bowl.</p>
<p>4. Put 10 tbsp of the butter in a medium skillet set over medium high heat. Allow the butter to melt for 2 minutes and begin to swirl it around the pan, allowing it to brown. Keep the butter moving so it doesn’t burn. Browning should take about 3 minutes and you’ll know it’s done when it smells nutty and it has a dark golden brown color. </p>
<p>5.	Transfer the butter to a large, heatsafe-mixing bowl. Add the remaining 4 tbsp of cold butter to the melted butter, and stir gently until it is melted.</p>
<p>6.	Add the white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla and salt to the butter and whisk the ingredients together. </p>
<p>7.	Add the egg and egg yolk and whisk again until mixture is smooth, 30 seconds. </p>
<p>8.	Allow the batter to rest for 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds more. Do this two more times; the end result should be thick and shiny.</p>
<p>9.	Add the flour mixture and stir until just combined, about 1 minute. Gently stir in chocolate chips and nuts, if using. The batter will be soft.</p>
<p>10.	Bake 10 to 14 minutes, you want them to be golden brown and set around the edges, but puffy in the middle. </p>

<p>Makes approximately 20-24 cookies</p>
