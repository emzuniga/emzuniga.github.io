The thought of using Terminal for anything makes me freak out internally. I went through the pre-work portion of using Terminal and I just did it to get it done. Period. Here we are, day 2 of class and we are instructed to open up Terminal in order to set up Git Hub. Let the freaking out begin...

It wasn't so bad. After doing the same commands over and over again it wasn't so scary. I can't wait to chat with the devs I work with and let them know, "I'm on yo level, son!" well, kind of.
