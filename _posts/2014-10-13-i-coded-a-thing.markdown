Last week was week 5 of this 10-week journey and I was finally able to "get" something. Lots of coaching was needed but still...little victories. I CODED SOMETHING! We had this assignment to code an "on-click" action that would show or hide corresponding images with the selected button. IT WORKED! At first my brain wanted to take the long route but they showed us how to do it with 3 very small lines of code. 

Today begings week 6 which means the begining of the the second half of this class. Here we go!
