<h1>About the author</h1>
I've finally decided that after over 10 years of working in the digital industry it was about time I learned to code myself. 
My name is Elaine Zuniga and this is a blog about my 10 week journey from knowing the absolute basics of HTML to hopefully learning a whole lot more including CSS, Java, JQuery and more.
Let the journey begin!
